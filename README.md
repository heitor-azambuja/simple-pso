# Simple Particle Swarm Optimization

The code in this repository implements a simple particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using python. It generates a surface plot of a 3d function and a 2d heatmap of it. Then it animates the particles movement on the heatmap.

PSO algorithm goal is to globaly optimize a function with 1 to n dimensions, finding its minimal or maximal value.
PSO strategy is inspired by birds flight and fish shoal movevment.
