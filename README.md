# Simple Particle Swarm Optimization

The code in this repository implements a simple particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using python. It generates a surface plot of a 3d function and a 2d heatmap of it. Then it animates the particles movement on the heatmap.

PSO algorithm goal is to globaly optimize a function with 1 to n dimensions, finding its minimal or maximal.
PSO strategy is inspired by birds flight and fish shoal movevment.

Read the tutorial aboud the implementation on [thrivingant.com](https://www.thrivingant.com) (work in progess)
## Instalation

This code only uses two libraries, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.1/index.html) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/). Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
